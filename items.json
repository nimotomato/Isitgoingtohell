On 29 October, a deadly crowd crush killed 156 people - mostly young people - and injured another 196 during Halloween festivities in the nightlife district of Itaewon. One week on, the authorities have launched an investigation, raiding municipal offices and local police and fire stations. The national police chief has apologised, as has President Yoon Suk-yeol, who has vowed to improve crowd control measures in the future. But it has not been enough to slake the public thirst for justice. Many feel   - an irony for a country known for its youthful, K-pop driven image on the international stage. On Saturday, activist and political groups rode on that wave of anger with at least seven vigil-protests across the capital. The biggest one was organised by Candlelight Action, an alliance of progressive groups, which had been holding regular political protests against President Yoon even before the Itaewon tragedy. It was held near City Hall which saw two lanes of a major road blocked off to accommodate tens of thousands of protesters. Many carried black protest signs that said \"Stepping down is an expression of condolence\"  - a pointed message for President Yoon. Onstage, speakers took turns to rail against the government in speeches interspersed with mournful song performances and prayers recited by Buddhist monks. \"Although the government clearly has responsibility, it is looking for perpetrators from irrelevant organisations\u2026 the incident occurred because the government did not play its very basic role,\" said one speaker. \"Step down, Yoon Suk-yeol's government! Step down, Yoon Suk-yeol's government!\" the crowd chanted, waving their candles and placards. Earlier in the day at Itaewon, a crowd of 200 protesters from various youth political groups gathered near the site of the incident.  Clad in black clothing and face masks, they held aloft banners that read: \"At 6:34 the country was not there [for the victims]\". This was a reference to the time of the first emergency call made to the police, hours before the crush actually happened.  .  After observing a minute of silence while facing the alley, their heads bowed, the group silently marched down the busy main thoroughfare of Itaewon. They held white chrysanthemums - the flower of grief in Korean culture - and black placards reading: \"We could have saved the victims, and the government should recognise their responsibility.\" \"I felt sad at first. But now I'm angry. I'm here because this incident could have been prevented. Those people were close to my age,\" said 22-year-old university student Kang Hee-joo. At their final stop, a war memorial, youth activists took turns to deliver speeches. \"This society is not normal, we are not safe. The government is not fulfilling its responsibility, it has pushed it to the youth\u2026 what kind of lesson did we learn from the Sewol incident?\" said one speaker, referencing the 2014 ferry disaster that killed more than 300 people, mostly high school students. \"They always promise change with every election. But why is there always a social disaster? This is what the young people are questioning,\" said another. Back at City Hall, a sea of candles flickered as night fell, bathing the masked faces of the protesters in a warm light. Many of them were middle-aged or older people. Yeom Sung-won, who has two young adult children, could still vividly recall the Sewol incident. \"That was very sad. And it's unbelievable this is happening again. That's why I've come here,\" said the 59-year-old architect as his eyes welled up with tears. \"I'm heartbroken, it's so senseless.\" \"The government has ignored them. It should protect its citizens and secure their safety no matter what.\" \u00a9 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. "},

Were it not for the single strip of orange tape, and the two police officers standing guard, you would pass it without a glance. On one side is the high, featureless wall of the Hamilton Hotel rising ten storeys. On the other, a cluster of small shops. A green sign marks \"Milano Collection\", a fashion store 81-year-old Nam In-seok has run for the past 11 years.  He witnessed the horrific event on , when the little alley became a death trap. \"Already at 19:00 I thought it was too crowded, and I was worried. It was very uncomfortable for the people walking, and the entrance to my shop was completely blocked.  \"People were lining up for a restaurant, and at the same time more people were trying to come up from the main street. \"At around 21:50, as I opened the door of my shop, two young women fell in. They had no shoes on, and they were covered with dirt and bruises. I hugged them to help them calm down.  \"I could hear people outside screaming 'help me'. I thought they might be fighting. I went outside and saw people piling up on top of each other.  \"People were screaming for help, and I tried to pull them out, but I couldn't. All those young people, they couldn't breathe, and they were completely exhausted.\" Mr Nam is haunted by what he saw that night. He stayed out trying to help the victims until 04:00.  \"I helped them clean up after the incident. There were so many things left on the street, such as shoes and bags. The police asked me to help collect the bags and clothes, so I did so. How could I go to sleep? I couldn't.\" At the peak of the crush, a little after 22:00, a video captured a single police officer struggling to disperse revellers from the top of the alley, who were unaware of the tragedy unfolding downhill.  \"Please move, people are dying\", he kept shouting - clearly distressed. An assistant inspector in Seoul,  , was on duty that night and has received a lot of praise for his efforts. But his own account of how he got to the scene is revealing.  The Itaewon police station is only a few hundred metres from the alley, yet he stayed there until the fatal crush took place.  When he was finally called out it was to investigate what he had been told was a possible fight. He had no idea until he got there that people were dying.  By that time the police had already received  the first at 18:34, alerting them to dangerous levels of overcrowding.  The public perception that one of Asia's most visible and efficient police forces did nothing to prevent this tragedy has shaken South Korea.  Each day the numbers of people coming to add their bouquets to the huge mound of white flowers near the alley have grown.  One woman screamed abuse at a police officer until she was pulled back by others explaining that it was not this individual's fault. President Yoon Suk-yeol has responded by setting up a special investigation team, but South Koreans have good reasons for being sceptical about whether the authorities will get to the bottom of what caused the deadly crush. South Korea experienced one of its worst peacetime disasters in 2014 when a ferry carrying 325 students from Danwon High School in Ansan - an industrial town about an hour south of Seoul - capsized.  Some 250 of the teenagers died, along with 11 of their teachers and 43 others. It later transpired that the ferry had been illegally altered and was overloaded with cargo that was not properly secured. The captain was   in prison for murder, and many others prosecuted.  The investigation was highly politicised, with then-President Park Geun-hye eventually being unseated, in part because of her perceived failure to respond adequately to the disaster.  Three separate inquiries failed to shed light on important aspects of the disaster. \"Nothing has been properly revealed in the past eight years since we lost our children,\" said Jang Dong-won, the father of Ae-jin, who survived the ferry sinking but lost six close friends.  \"That anxiety, that the truth will once again be concealed this time, feels like another trauma for us. Why do young people, who have seen so little of life, have to die?  \"A tragedy like this should not happen anymore. I really hope that this time the truth will be revealed, and I can live happily with my family in a really safe country.\" He now heads the 4/16 Sewol Families for Truth and A Safer Society, the group campaigning for full accountability for the disaster.  He spoke to me at the centre they have established in Ansan, not far from the school, to support bereaved parents. This sense, that a younger, more innocent generation has been betrayed once again by an older, more cynical one, is widely shared. \"The older generation has again sent young people to their deaths,\" wrote one TikTok user. \"Why do we let the past bite our future? Will we ever break this endless cycle?\" Another person on YouTube wrote: \"As a Korean citizen in his 20s, I really feel that my country won't protect me. I am so depressed.  \"Am I really living in South Korea, a developed country in the 21st Century? Who should we, the young people, trust to keep living in this country?  \"The politicians think they just need to hold onto their power, and don't need to take any responsibility. This attitude makes me sick.\" The belief that safety in South Korea is sacrificed at the altar of the country's headlong economic growth is nothing new.  It has been expressed after every big disaster - and the country has certainly had its share of them - and elicited promises that official attitudes to safety will change.  On the eighth anniversary of the ferry disaster, then President-elect Yoon Suk-yeol made a promise on his Facebook page.  \"I believe making South Korea safer is the most sincere way to express condolences to the victims,\" he wrote.  As public anger builds, President Yoon will find his government being tested and challenged over that promise. \u00a9 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. "},

By Dearbail Jordan & Daniel Thomas Business reporter, BBC News The Bank of England raises interest rates to 3%, marking the biggest rise for 33 years. By Faisal Islam Economics editor An economic downturn would usually mean an easing of rates, but there's inflation to tackle too. By Michael Race Business reporter, BBC News The Bank of England's outlook for the UK is grim, but some things might not be as bad as first expected. The British Chambers of Commerce has described the interest rate rise as \"further bad news for businesses\". Its head of research, David Bharier, said many firms were already struggling because of rising costs of raw materials, energy and borrowing - all while demand from customers is going down. He pointed out that pressure could continue to mount on businesses as help with energy bills expires next April. \u201cWith the chancellor and prime minister both\nsignalling that the Autumn Statement is likely to result in\nspending cuts and tax rises, businesses will be extremely worried about what\nthe future holds,\" he said. He added that it was \"crucial\" for the government to set out a long-term plan to stabilise the economy and help it grow. Tim Bannister from property website Rightmove has said that \"the era of historically low interest rates looks to be over\", making it more difficult for those new first-time buyers hoping to get on the housing ladder. But, he pointed out that mortgage rates have started to stabilise and fall after the market turmoil seen in the wake of former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget. \"As today\u2019s rise was expected, we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see\nany significant changes to new fixed rate deals based solely on today\u2019s\ninterest rate rise,\" he said. He added: \"It\u2019s important to look beyond the headline\nnumbers, because, while 'like-for-like' mortgage costs have been increasing,\nmortgage brokers and lenders will be able to help people assess the different\noptions available to manage their costs and see if they can afford to move.\" The Bank of England, the UK's central bank, has warned that the UK faces a tough two years ahead - and the longest recession since records began. It believes the economy entered a \"challenging\" downturn this summer, which will continue next year and into the first half of 2024 - a possible general election year. It blames the UK's economic problems on very sharp increases in prices, especially for energy and food.  If you're looking for more information on what a recession means, and how it could affect you, click on our latest explainer  . The government is \"taking the difficult decisions\" to bring down the UK's debt, says the chancellor. Labour\u2019s economic plan would \"provide the economic stability we need\", says the shadow chancellor. After lifting its base rate to the highest level for 14 years, the Bank of England also warned that \"many\" homeowners will probably face higher payments. Existing mortgage-holders on fixed-rate products, which make up about 80% of mortgages, will face an increase in repayments when their fix comes to an end. Those coming off a fixed rate mortgage at 2.5%, renewing a mortgage of \u00a3130,000 borrowed over 20 years, or finding a new one, could see about \u00a33,000 a year added to their bills if they locked in a rate of 5.5%, for example. Of course, the cost of borrowing will vary according to how much somebody has borrowed, the terms of their new mortgage and when it is up for renewal. But overall, the Bank expects that higher mortgage rates will weigh on consumers' appetite for spending. By Philip Sim BBC Scotland political correspondent Why is the Scottish government having to cut its budget, and what will it mean for our public services? The cost of living is increasing at its fastest rate in 40 years, due to rising food and energy prices. The UK could be set for its longest recession since records began, the Bank of England has warned. Faisal Islam Economics editor The Bank has done something it doesn\u2019t\nnormally do in the published minutes of its decisions  - it has given guidance that seems to suggest a peak in interest rates of about 4.5% next Autumn.  For those with a glass half-full - this is lower than the 6% assumed just a month ago in the post mini-budget market turmoil. While government borrowing\ncosts and the level of the pound has somewhat recovered after a series of U-turns since, mortgage markets and business loans\nare still showing some stress, adding to the prolonged hit to the\neconomy.  The forecast predicts that the unemployment rate will rise to 6%, while household incomes will come down too.  It is a picture of a painful economic period,\nwith the UK performing worse than the US and the Eurozone. Indeed, what was\nforecast as a sharp energy recession just three months ago, is now a shallower,\nbut more prolonged energy and mortgage shock. Experts have said that the Bank of England will be left with few \"easy choices\" as the UK economy deteriorates. Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK said that a potential new spike in the soaring cost of living could come when the government support on energy bills offered under the Energy Price Guarantee comes to an end in April. That could put pressure on the Monetary Policy Committee to raise rates even more quickly, she said. \u201cAt\nthe same time, the outlook is riddled by the evolution of energy prices, while\nthe risk of a significant fall in house prices looms in the background.\" She said that the UK economy could shrink by more than 2% by the end of next year. Although it would ease pressures pushing prices up, it would see households and businesses face even more difficulties.

{"Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-63505168", "Text": "This video can not be played Watch: Seoul police officer expresses sorrow over crush, saying \"I don't feel I did my best\" An assistant inspector in the South Korean capital, he was on duty that night.  \"We had received a report of an altercation in the area, so I arrived at the scene between 10.10pm and 10.15pm,\" he tells the BBC at his police station in Itaewon, just a few metres away from where the tragedy occurred. He says he saw people lying on the ground, and heard screams. \"I tried to do my duty, to help people. Unfortunately I wasn't able to,\" he says. But a video shared on social media, showing his desperate efforts to divert people away from the alleyway, has earned him praise from South Koreans, even as it highlights the inadequate police presence on the ground that night. In it, you see a lone young figure in uniform - deep worry on his face - frantically trying to stem the vast tide of bodies away from the narrow slope on which more than 150 people would ultimately lose their lives. \"People are dying!\" he shouts desperately. \"Everyone move this way - please co-operate!\" Inspector Kim wasn't even supposed to be there. Despite being based in the heart of Itaewon, he hadn't been deployed to the streets that evening.  Those streets would eventually be filled by more than 100,000 people, mostly young, who had come to enjoy a Halloween night out. \"I was at the station, waiting to be dispatched for any crimes which could occur in Itaewon that night,\" he says. There had been no mention of crowd control - either on the night or in the days leading up to Halloween. \"We received the report of the altercation near the alleyway, so I immediately went to the location.\" This was when Inspector Kim saw the crowds were dangerously packed. People were being crushed at the bottom of the sloped alleyway that connects a main road with bar-lined streets on a hill.  To try to prevent more crushing at the bottom, he decided that he needed to stop people from entering at the top of the alleyway. \"As you can see in the video, I started shouting and asking people to move along to another place,\" he says. Most of the people around him complied and in fact many started to help him direct the crowds. Soon dozens would be giving CPR to victims as crowd control efforts quickly turned into a rescue operation.  Inspector Kim says he did not see any other police officers on the scene, although he was later told others did take part in the rescue. Working alone - without a megaphone or any basic plan of action - he was faced with the impossible task of trying to prevent a disaster as it unfolded in front of him.  The huge loss of life has left him with a heavy sense of guilt. \"I feel I didn't do my best. I didn't fulfil my duty as a Korean police officer and I'm very sorry,\" he says. On Thursday, the mother of a victim contacted Inspector Kim to convey her gratitude for his actions on the night. \"I was too sorry to say thank you to her,\" he says.  \"I couldn't do my job that night. If I can somehow meet the bereaved family members and express my apologies and talk to them, I would like to do that.\" Those families now want answers as anger towards the authorities grows in South Korea. On Wednesday, special investigators raided eight police stations across Seoul to gather evidence as part of a probe into how the crush was able to happen. Proof is mounting of the authorities' failures. First, to properly plan for Saturday night and then, to effectively respond to emergency calls warning of overcrowding, which started coming in hours before the disaster. In the days leading up to the tragedy, the local council, Yongsan-gu, held two meetings to discuss how to handle the Halloween festivities. According to its website, they discussed Covid-19, rubbish collection and illegal parking, among other things.  No mention was made about crowd control, despite the district mayor acknowledging the day before that this would be the first Halloween in three years without social distancing. On Tuesday, South Korea's police chief admitted that his force's emergency response had been \"inadequate\" and that he felt \"heavy responsibility\" for the deaths. The efforts of Inspector Kim, though, have drawn admiration from the general public. But he wants the focus to remain on the victims' families. \"A lot of people have contacted me and asked if I was OK,\" he says.  \"But rather than worrying about me, think about the bereaved families who will be suffering the most. Please pray for them.\" \u00a9 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. "},

It's a lively party spot with many narrow streets and alleys filled with bars and restaurants. Some accounts say more than 100,000 had descended on the area that evening. The neighbourhood is served by Itaewon metro station, and videos on social media show streams of people arriving to celebrate Halloween from early evening on Saturday. Nuhyil Ahammed, 32, was in the crowd. The IT worker from India lives nearby and had been to Halloween parties in Itaewon before, but says things were very different this year. \"It was crazy,\" he told the BBC. \"From 5pm there were too many people on the streets. So I was thinking, what's it going to be like from seven or eight?\"  Around this time, social media messages were being posted online with people saying that the streets of the district were so crowded they felt unsafe.  The first call to police from Itaewon came at 18:34 local time - several hours before the deadly crush took place in an alley off the main road. \"That alley is really dangerous right now people going up and down, so people can't come down, but people keep coming up, it's gonna be crushed. I barely made it to get out but it's too crowded. I think you should control it,\" the caller said. The police officer asked if the caller meant that people weren't flowing well, that \"they get crushed and fall, and then there's going to be a big accident?\" Yes, the caller responded - \"this is so chilling right now\". The police officer told the first caller they would send someone \"to go and check it out\" - but no significant reinforcements were sent for hours. Authorities said they had 137 officers on the ground at Itaewon that night. But they were clearly outmatched by the many thousands that flocked to the area. Videos show people converging into a narrow alley next to the Hamilton shopping mall where the worst overcrowding was reported. There were at least ten more emergency calls from the area in the next three and a half hours, for which the  The next few calls started coming in about two hours later, from 20:09 onwards. Callers described seeing people stumbling after they were pushed, and getting injured. At 20:53, one caller described a harrowing situation near a nightclub on the alley. \"I feel like I am going to get crushed\u2026 many people are being crushed\u2026 it is chaos.\" They repeatedly begged \"please help us\". The caller was reassured that police would be sent to the scene. But records show they were not, and out of the 11 phone calls made to police, they only mobilised officers for four of them. The police did not dispatch anyone for in response to calls made from 21:07 onwards - the hour leading up to the crush. In the last call at 22:11 - one of the briefest made - the caller said: \"It feels like people can get crushed here.\" Minutes later, the deadly crush began. At about 22:15 a number of people on the sloping pathway fell over. Crowds pressing from both ends of the alley made it impossible to get out. Social media footage shows some people trying to climbing up the sides of the buildings to escape. At 22:24, fire authorities say they received reports that 10 people were pushed down under the crowd and experiencing breathing difficulties. At 22:27, the first four ambulances were dispatched, followed by six more a few minutes later, according to the authorities. \"People began pushing from behind, it was like a wave - there was nothing you could do,\" Mr Ahammed said, who found himself caught up in a huge crowd. \"People were suffocating, screaming, getting squeezed, falling... there were just too many people\" By 23:00, 30 more ambulances were deployed, as well as more than 100 national disaster medical assistance teams, with all Halloween events being called off by authorities at 23:19. Videos from the scene show dozens of people attempting CPR on victims in the street. Dead bodies lay covered with blue sheets.  Ana, a 24-year-old from Spain was also in the area, with her friend, Melissa, a 19-year-old from Germany. The pair were in a bar and tried to leave at about 23:00 when they saw ambulances trying to enter the alley and police asking people to move to make way for dead bodies and the injured.  \"There were so many people that they needed normal people to do CPR. So everyone started jumping in to help,\" Ana told the BBC.

By Faisal Islam Economics editor An economic downturn would usually mean an easing of rates, but there's inflation to tackle too. Tim Bannister from property website Rightmove has said that \"the era of historically low interest rates looks to be over\", making it more difficult for those new first-time buyers hoping to get on the housing ladder. But, he pointed out that mortgage rates have started to stabilise and fall after the market turmoil seen in the wake of former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget. \"As today\u2019s rise was expected, we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll see\nany significant changes to new fixed rate deals based solely on today\u2019s\ninterest rate rise,\" he said. He added: \"It\u2019s important to look beyond the headline\nnumbers, because, while 'like-for-like' mortgage costs have been increasing,\nmortgage brokers and lenders will be able to help people assess the different\noptions available to manage their costs and see if they can afford to move.\" The government is \"taking the difficult decisions\" to bring down the UK's debt, says the chancellor.

Victoria Scholar, head of investment at Interactive Investor, says that the Bank of England is \"likely to be divided\" today, with some policymakers on its Monetary Policy Committee pushing for a smaller increase in the base rate of 0.5 percentage points. \"The size of the increase will signal how concerned Bank of England policymakers are about inflation versus a recession as it looks to curtail further price rises without inadvertently causing unnecessary economic pain,\" she said. She pointed out that the mortgage market has calmed down since former Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng's mini-budget and the U-turns that followed.

{"Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/business-63521713", "Text": "The billionaire owner of Tesla   that \"activists\" raising concerns about how Twitter is moderated are \"trying to destroy free speech in America\". It came as Twitter made widespread job cuts around the world on Friday. Reports suggested that thousands of staff lost their jobs. Yoel Roth, the company's head of safety and integrity, appeared to confirm   that \"approximately 50%\" of Twitter's workforce had been cut company-wide. He added that most of the 2,000+ content moderators \"working on front-line review were not impacted\" by the cuts.  Mr Musk posted  , saying he was presented \"no choice\" over what he called Twitter's \"reduction in force\", as the company was losing $4m (\u00a33.51m) a day. He insisted that all those losing their jobs were offered three months of severance pay, \"which is 50% more than legally required\". Addressing the topic of content moderation, he said Twitter's \"strong commitment\" remained \"absolutely unchanged\". Online safety groups and campaigners have expressed concerns about Mr Musk's plans to relax content moderation and reverse permanent Twitter bans given to controversial figures, including former US president Donald Trump. An internal email sent to staff earlier on Friday said the mass job cuts were \"unfortunately necessary to ensure the company's success moving forward\". Staff confirmed on Twitter they had been logged out of work laptops and Slack, a messaging system. Many staff revealed that they had been axed in posts on the platform, painting a picture of cuts that spanned the globe and hit departments that ranged from marketing to engineering. They included communications, content curation, and product development employees. A team that focused on research into how Twitter uses algorithms - an issue that was a priority for Mr Musk - was also sacked, according to a tweet from a former senior manager at the company. But that was later denied.  Almost all of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising and Volkswagen is among the brands that has stopped spending with it since Mr Musk bought the social media company. \"We are closely monitoring the situation and will decide about next steps depending on its evolvement,\" Europe's biggest carmaker said. On Thursday, food manufacturer General Mills, which owns brands including Cheerios and Lucky Charms, did the same. It said it was continuing to monitor the social media company's \"new direction\" and wanted to \"evaluate [its] marketing spend\". Other brands to have paused paid activity on the platform include car firms General Motors and Audi, and drugs giant Pfizer. Mr Musk has been looking for ways to cut costs and make money in different ways from the platform, including plans to charge a monthly subscription fee for users to be verified on the platform. He also proposed that those paying the $8 per month fee would get their Tweets boosted in replies, mentions, and searches, prompting criticism from some people on Twitter that he was creating a two-tier system that would benefit those willing to pay. Twitter employees filed a class action lawsuit on Thursday which argued the company was making big job cuts without giving 60 days' notice, in violation of federal and Californian law. The lawsuit also asked the San Francisco federal court to order Twitter not to ask sacked employees to sign documents waiving their rights without telling them about the court case. Shannon Liss-Riordan, the lawyer co-ordinating the case, said: \"We filed this federal complaint to ensure that Twitter be held accountable to our laws and to aid Twitter employees by helping them understand their rights.\" Twitter was approached for comment. \u00a9 2022 BBC.

{"Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-63493606", "Text": "A few hours' drive out of Denver, the capital city in the centre of Colorado, an enormous sign can be seen from the side of the highway: white background, pink-and-black font, pasted on to an old, hulking trailer.  \"This Is Boebert Country,\" it reads.  \"Boebert\" refers to Lauren Boebert.  The 35-year-old Republican represents Colorado's third congressional district, a vast stretch of land that spans the entire western half of the state. Though she has not passed a single piece of legislation in her first term in office, Ms Boebert has emerged as one of the most high-profile Republican newcomers in Congress owing to her unabashed Trumpism. She picked routine fights with Democratic colleagues - labelling one group the \"Jihad Squad\" - and falsely claimed that liberals had legalised \"knowingly spreading HIV\". A staunch defender of gun rights, she vowed to bring her handgun to the Capitol. The 2021 Boebert family Christmas card featured a photo of the congresswoman and her three young sons, all wielding rifles. That maverick brand of Republicanism stands in stark contrast to the party's Senate candidate, Joe O'Dea, 60.  Unlike Ms Boebert, Mr O'Dea supports abortion access and immigration reforms, and said he would actively campaign against former President Donald Trump if he were to run again. The two political newcomers - Ms Boebert and Mr O'Dea - offer a picture of a Republican Party at war with itself. And in Colorado ahead of the election, it is Ms Boebert's party in control: she is on course to win, while Mr O'Dea is expected to lose. Some political fissures in Colorado can be understood through its geography.  As a candidate running for state-wide office, Mr O'Dea has had to appeal to the political centre, while Ms Boebert has a much more contained constituency. Almost all of \"Boebert country\", including cities like Durango, Grand Junction and Ms Boebert's home of Rifle, are on the west side of the so-called 'Great Divide' - a literal fracture in the earth that forms the Rocky Mountains.  It is mostly rural, mostly white, and mostly Republican. Poverty rates are nearly double that of the state as a whole.  This area, called the Western Slope, is effectively cleaved off from the rest of Colorado - the ice-capped mountains acting as both an ideological and physical barrier.  \"Western Slope\" is also something of a shorthand for blue collar, pro-gun, anti-elitism, existing in opposition to liberal havens like Boulder and Denver, where a Democrat sits in the governor's mansion. \"The population centres, the economic centres, the political centres are all on the other side of the mountains,\" said Justin Gollob, a politics professor at Colorado Mesa University. People who live in the West are attracted to its isolation, Mr Gollob said. But it has also bred resentment, a feeling of being walked over and ignored by the Democrats in charge in Denver and Washington. \"I think it's an attitude that, you know, we live in the civilised world and you guys are a bunch of rednecks,\" said Kevin McCarney, an insurance advisor and local Republican party chairman. On the trail, Ms Boebert - who has spoken of growing up on government benefits - speaks directly to the anger and alienation bubbling through the Western Slope, railing against \"radical\" Democrats, who are \"destroying America\".  \"She's down to earth. I can relate to her, I can relate to her background,\" said Jennifer Wilcox, who runs a non-profit in the district for women living in poverty.  In Colorado last week, many residents also expressed concern and disbelief that President Biden would commit billions to student loan forgiveness while blue-collar families struggle amid soaring inflation. \"Only about one-third of adults in this country have a bachelor's degree. It's a little bit less than that in [the third district],\" said Adam Frisch, the Democrat running against Ms Boebert. \"This is why the Democrats have lost support in rural America\u2026 it's the ultimate in tone deaf.\" An analysis of national election results by NBC News found that while Bill Clinton won more than 50% of all rural counties in 1996, Barack Obama won just half of that in 2008. Joe Biden fared even worse, winning less than 5% in 2020. Mr Frisch wears his party affiliation lightly, careful to distance himself from the left-wing of the party. \"I spend a lot of time letting people know I don't have blue horns growing out of my head,\" he said. Some Democrats, like Colorado's sitting governor or Mr O'Dea's opponent, Senator Michael Bennet, have found a workaround for the lack of rural support, relying on strong backing from populous urban centres and then appealing to suburban voters - a bloc courted by both parties. It was the registered Republicans in suburbia who helped Mr O'Dea eke out a victory over his far-right opponent in the primaries. His win was \"an exception to the rule of the Republican party right now\", said Gunner Ramer, political director of the Republican Accountability Project, an anti-Trump Republican group. \"Across the country Donald Trump, election deniers and anti-establishment candidates have taken over the Republican party at all levels of government.\" But the Republican nominee will probably come up short next week, lacking the urban popularity offered to Democrats as well as populist fervour for \"Maga\" stars. He is five points behind in the Senate race, according to an average of recent polls. In effect, he'll be squeezed from both sides while Ms Boebert sails to re-election.  \u00a9 2022 BBC.

{"Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-63483369", "Text": "This isn't the first time that Anoop B, from the southern Indian state of Kerala, has faced such a situation. Two months after hitting the jackpot in a government lottery, the 32-year-old says that his life has changed in ways he couldn't imagine. He can't step out of his house without being recognised, many friends and relatives are upset with him, and almost everyone he meets asks for money.  \"Many people who were once close have stopped talking to us now,\" he says. Anoop made national headlines in September after he won a whopping 250m rupees ($3.01m, \u00a32.7m) - the highest ever offered in the state for a lottery. The lottery is illegal in many Indian states but a few, including Kerala, allow it with strict regulations. But a few days later,   -  this time for a video in which he asked people to stop harassing him and his family for money. At the time, he said he wished he hadn't won the jackpot. When the BBC contacted Anoop this week, he was reluctant to speak at first. He also requested that his photo not be published as \"every new article brings another wave of attention\". \"I think you can only understand what it's like if you've been through this,\" he says over the phone. \"It's like a scene from a movie. Suddenly, everyone you know is at your house.\" The chef-turned-tuk-tuk driver from Thiruvananthapuram district had been buying lottery tickets for over a decade, and had even won small amounts earlier. But the jackpot changed his life in ways with which he is still struggling to come to terms. \"People's attitude towards you changes overnight,\" he says. In the weeks after the announcement, his house and neighbourhood were overrun with hundreds of people who wanted help. \"We would wake up to find a crowd outside. It would start from 5am and they'd stay there till late in the night,\" he recalls. Anoop's wife, Maya, had told a local news channel that the couple had discussed the possibility of helping people once they received the money.  \"People picked up on the offhand mention of help and ran with it,\" she says.  Requests for money poured in from across the state. Some asked for help paying off their mortgage or loans, while others requested assistance with their daughters' wedding expenses. \"There were so many calls from banks and insurance agents,\" he says. \"A group came to me from Chennai asking for help funding a film.\" Apart from genuine requests, the couple also dealt with people who felt they had a claim to the money. \"One man sat in our house all day demanding that I buy him a Royal Enfield motorbike,\" Anoop says. \"Everyone thinks I got this money for free, by doing nothing, and so they ask why I can't just give them some,\" he says. Online rumours also affected their peace, the couple says. \"There were social media posts saying that I was lying about winning, that I already had a lot of money and that my win was fraudulent,\" he says. Anoop says he is still wary of going out in public.  \"People recognise me wherever I go because my face was on so many news channels, websites and newspapers.\" He's also worried about the safety of his wife - now eight months pregnant - and toddler son. But one thing that gave him solace was knowing his experience was not unique. In October, while appearing on a game show on a local TV channel, Anoop met Jayapalan, 59, who had won the same jackpot last year. Jayapalan, who won 120m rupees, had experienced a similar flurry of media attention and requests for financial assistance. \"It became hard to tell who actually needed help and who just wanted money,\" he said on the show.  \"Friends become enemies,\" Jayapalan, who still drives a tuk-tuk, added. \"Many are still upset that I didn't give them money.\" He had to file police complaints after receiving some threatening letters, and has installed CCTV cameras around his house. His advice to Anoop was to be very careful with the money. \"People think winning the lottery wipes out all my concerns about money. But everything is still uncertain. I don't know how much I'll be left with after taxes,\" Anoop says.  The calculations around how much prize money the winner receives is \"complicated\", both the winners said on the show. Apart from a 30% tax cut by the state government at the time of handing over the winnings and the commission deducted by the ticket agent, the winner must also pay a cess and surcharge to the federal government. After the ruckus created by Anoop's win, the state government organised a day's training programme on financial management to help him use the money well. He now plans to wait a few years before deciding what to do with his winnings. \"There's no doubt that the money is a blessing,\" he says.  \"But before I do anything or help anyone else, I need to manage it well to make sure that my family is taken care of and their future is secure.\" \u00a9 2022 BBC.

{"Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/disability-63485291", "Text": "Wearing my lovely new walking boots, I suddenly realise I have stumbled on a \"midden\" - a pungent pile of rhinoceros poo. With every gust of wind I get a fresh whiff. I am at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy - a 90,000-acre wild animal sanctuary on the equator in Kenya. The keepers there let me reach out and touch the skin of a rhino called Baraka. Like me, Baraka is blind His skin is not as smooth and lizard-like as I expected it to be - it feels rough, like cardboard.  He lost his right eye in a fight with another rhino - and a cataract stops him from seeing out of his left eye. He has to be kept alone because other rhinos would attack him - and his keepers tell me he can be nervous about moving around. Trees in his big enclosure have damaged trunks and broken branches, from where he has walked into them.  I sympathise with him. I was also nervous when I was asked to travel halfway around the world on a trip which, for most people, would be the opportunity of a lifetime. Not only would it be very different from my usual life of advocacy work for the UK's blind and partially sighted community - both in person and on YouTube - but it would also mean leaving behind my beloved guide dog, Molly. I lost my sight nearly 10 years ago - when I was 17 - due to a genetic condition. It took me a while to get used to going on holidays as a non-sighted person, which I used to view as just a really expensive way of basically being in my back garden. I now know I can still enjoy foreign travel, despite not being able to see - but going on a safari? Surely it's a \"must see\" experience? I felt a lot better after I met my safari guide, William. He had taken a blind person on a similar trip once before - but, because every non-sighted person has varying levels of visual acuity, we still needed to get to know each other. My visual memories of most things - including wild African animals - are almost completely gone. Those that remain are like a series of photos which have been locked in a drawer in my brain for the past decade. If I try to recall an elephant for example, a visual memory comes out of the drawer of an animal tapestry my sister had on her bedroom wall when we were children.  So I was going to have to start from scratch and make sure I got a great experience from using my other senses. I know it may sound weird, but I genuinely don't miss having my eyesight, and even in Kenya I didn't spend time wishing I still had it. First, William took me to a museum in Nairobi where I was allowed to touch stuffed exhibits. I rely so much on my other senses now, so to be able to reach out and feel the skins of elephants and giraffes really helped me start to \"see\". My senses then really started to awaken as we drove out from the city in our four-wheel drive vehicle. The ground became so bumpy as we sped along, and the car smelled of sand which wafted into my face in the wind. I wore sunglasses and put my head out of the window - I really wanted to drink in the atmosphere.  At the Ol Pejeta sanctuary, William and the keepers brilliantly described the rhinos and elephants in front of us - how they were moving, eating, reacting to us and each other. It all helped paint pictures in my head. James Mwenda, a global ambassador for the sanctuary, crouched down with me and we felt the footprint of a rhino in the dusty ground.  We then put our hands in a pile of dung. Much of it is just semi-digested grass, he told me. I gave it a good sniff - it just smelled of grass that had \"gone off\". Visually impaired social media star Lucy Edwards heads to Kenya to experience one of the largest animal migrations in the world.  We drove in search of lions - tracking a special collar worn by one of the lionesses who, like me, is called Lucy. We pulled up slowly alongside her - she was fast asleep. We were so close I could hear her breathing through the window.  I asked William if she looked like the lions in The Lion King? That was the last image of the animals I had stored in my memory vault. Yes - he told me. And her cubs, close by, looked just like the movie's young hero, Simba. The sensory overload continued on our midnight safari. It seemed as though I could smell so much more than in the daytime, and hear every little sound. I was so lucky to experience a bush kill.  We had suddenly heard a loud screeching noise. We drove quickly, over really bumpy ground, down into a ditch. I then listened as two lions chased a herd of buffalo - before hearing the sound of bones cracking and flesh being chewed. It was such a privilege. This video can not be played Lucy with the elephants: \"It's really lovely that I can hear them in real life\" We then headed south to the Masai Mara game reserve - the wild Africa of storybooks. We pulled into a village of the Maasai tribe and, before I even had the chance to get out of the car, we were surrounded by local women trying to sell us carved wooden animals. It was crazy. I bartered with them and bought two giraffes.  Flies buzzed around my face as we walked, and I could hear bells clanking - I was told they were tied around the necks of goats. In a hut, with the smell of wood all around me, I tried on some traditional Maasai clothing. Tartan patterns and lots of red, I was told. I loved the feel and noise of the beaded jewellery which I also wore.  Outside, I was then treated to an amazing audio experience - traditional Maasai singing and chanting. A wall of sound was all around me. I had really wanted to experience the sounds and smells of the \"great migration\" - when millions of wildebeest and other herbivores, like zebras, make the dangerous trip from the Serengeti in Tanzania to Kenya in search of fresh grass. Predators - big cats and crocodiles - wait to pick off the weakest travellers. Deep in Masai Mara, in the early morning, we found tens of thousands of the animals. They were all around us. Herd leaders were calling out, making moaning sounds. The noise was everywhere - like it was in 3D. I held a small wooden model of a wildebeest, as William described the sight before us. Wildebeest have very weak legs compared to the size of their bodies, he told me, and some will break bones when they jump in rivers to cross. The top is like a horse, with horns like a cow and a beard like a goat. The giant herd set off for another day's travelling. I could hear the pit-pat of hooves on the ground and then, as they tumbled down a riverbank, the sound of water sloshing around. Being on safari had been amazing, but there was one experience which I had really worried about - because I wasn't going to be able to see it. It was the so-called \"sundowner\" moment, when people sit and have a drink at the end of the day, watching the sky turn orange and red as the sun disappears over the horizon.  But when the moment actually came, there was no sunset - it poured with rain instead. I cried happy tears. It was as though the world was letting me know that I didn't need to see the sun.  It hadn't rained for weeks and weeks, but the heavens had opened just for me. The giant raindrops, and the sound they made as they splashed down, felt like a perfect sensory end to what had been the best trip of my life.  \u00a9 2022 BBC.

Health experts are worried a so-called tripledemic of flu, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and coronavirus could swamp hospitals this winter. At least 730 people have died of flu this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). While older people are the most vulnerable age group, at least four children are among the dead. CDC data shows there have been at least 1.6 million flu cases overall and some 13,000 people have been taken to hospital.  This season's severity has not been matched at this point in the year since the H1N1 swine flu pandemic hit the US in 2009. \"There's no doubt we will face some challenges this winter,\" Dawn O'Connell, the US Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) assistant secretary for preparedness and response, said at a media briefing on Friday. Flu season in the US typically peaks in December and January but has surged early and rapidly this year. Health officials said the coronavirus pandemic had sharply curbed the spread of flu and other respiratory viruses, So many young children are now encountering them for the first time, but may have little to no immunity, said the officials. The early arrival of flu season has been compounded by a rise in Covid hospital admissions, fuelled by the spread of different Omicron subvariants. It has also coincided with a country-wide surge in RSV, a cold-like infection that is estimated to claim more than 14,000 lives annually in the US, mostly among older Americans. \u00a9 2022 BBC.

{"Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-suffolk-63439430", "Text": "Between September 1972 and March 1973, more than 27,000 refugees arrived in the UK, with the first 2,000 being housed initially at a camp at RAF Stradishall between Haverhill and Bury St Edmunds, before moving to settle in other parts of the UK. To mark the anniversary, an oral history project entitled   has gathered the stories of some of those who arrived at the camp as well as the volunteers who worked there.  The BBC has used some of these resources to tell their experiences of life at the Suffolk resettlement centre.  Prof Akbar Vohra was a young boy when he arrived at Stradishall on 27 September 1972 along with his parents, brother and two sisters. The Ugandan Asian refugees were forced by the Amin government to leave all their valuables and money in Uganda, taking just one suitcase per person and \u00a355.   \"My mother was told to leave the doors open so people could go in and take what they wanted,\" he said. \"Obviously I got strip-searched when we were at the airport. Obviously they were looking for valuables.  \"Personally I just had a little blue marble and a magnet which I still have somewhere, it was my prize possession.\" \"Two or three things I can remember - getting off the plane, still in shorts, my knees were knocking as I got off the plane thinking wow this is cold,\" he said. He remembers being \"really pleased\" to be given given a coat from the \"piles and piles of clothes\" in the administrative building at Stradishall.   \"I loved the boiled eggs that they were doing, and eggs in general. I can't remember the other food really. It doesn't really stick in my mind as being horrible. \"The water was terrible, awful, the food okay.\" His family only stayed at the camp for about two weeks as his father managed to secure a job in Peterborough.  They travelled by coach from Stradishall to a furnished terraced house. The neighbours showed Prof Vohra's parents how to light a coal fire as \"we had never seen coal\". \"The support we got to integrate from people our own age and neighbours was terrific,\" he said. Mr Vohra will soon retire as a professor of anaesthesia in intensive care at Manchester Royal Infirmary. \"I've been lucky that I've had a really great career, in teaching and education. I've taught all round the world,\" he said.  \"History is important, reflecting on how small acts of kindness, which are in your gift, can make a big difference to other people's lives. \"I'd like to think that I've taught so many doctors and nurses, and other operating departments, people in this country as well as abroad, and if I'd not have had the opportunity or support to come here, if my family hadn't been given a furnished house by Peterborough Council to settle down, I wouldn't be here.\" Teacher Sheila Bailey helped set up a playgroup for the younger refugees at Stradishall.  As the camp expanded, \"bored\" older children started coming along, prompting Suffolk's education authority to help provide a school. Several classrooms were set up in the hangers and more staff were brought in, said Ms Bailey. \"I don't remember there being any particular guidance on what we should be teaching them other than a gist of what being in England was like,\" she said. \"And keeping going the general English and maths, they all seemed to be pretty hot at maths.\" Singing and art activities also went down really well.  \"I decided to do a sawdust firing and making these little thumb pots,\" said Ms Bailey. \"They were a little disappointed when all the pots came out black and quickly rectified that by demanding bright colours to paint them with.\" The children were taught English country songs. \"Life for them was so strange and so odd,\" said Ms Bailey. \"They were just pleased to be free and safe. \"The children were very rewarding.\" Steven Poulton was a police cadet despatched to Stradishall and helped manage the telephone switchboard at night. He was also involved with new arrivals, who would turn-up in the middle of the night. \"I'd never seen so many non-white people, living as I did at that time in a quiet rural county, the non-white faces were were almost non-existent,\" he said. \"The colours I remember were amazing, made our English garb look dull and dreary.  \"It was good fun from the point of view we were meeting a completely new set of people... and could be of assistance to them. \"It went from long lines of sad and lonely and frightened people that used to appear out of the coaches, to people leaving with a lot more happiness, joy and enthusiasm in their whole being,\" he said. Alan Cordy, lived nearby in the village of Chedburgh.  Then a 17-year-old boy, he remember the refugees driving past the base and \"just seeing so many displaced people out there, lost, they looked lost\".  \"They were lost weren't they, at the end of the day, it's something that stays with me,\" Mr Cordy said. He was aware the Ugandans were coming to the UK after seeing stories of the expulsion on the news.  \"Suddenly to have all these people who'd got nothing, who had to try and sort themselves out, find their relatives, get them to work and eventually settle down in the country.\" He said \"sadly history is repeating itself\" with the situation in Ukraine.  Mayur Seta arrived at the camp aged seven.  His extended family of seven \"only had the clothes they were wearing and a few bits and pieces\" although his aunty managed to smuggle some jewellery out in his cousin's teddy bear. \"I was very excited because I was on an aeroplane, I was excited I was flying,\" he said.  Landing at Stansted in Essex in early October, he remembers being taken to a room at the airport, given tea and biscuits as well as coats, jumpers and other warm clothes before being taken to Stradishall late in the night. A problem arose on the first evening after the refugees were offered dinner which contained meat, which they did not eat.  Mr Seta said his mother and a few ladies approached the manager of the canteen to ask if they could cook the meals instead.  After being given permission, a team went to an Asian food shop in Cambridge, to buy ingredients to make up an Indian thali menu, which they began serving daily. \"Within two days we were having an Indian meal every day, which was fantastic,\" he said.  Mr Seta and his extended family of seven lived in a \"really comfortable house\" on the base.  The experience of leaving Uganda became a distant memory as he so enjoyed his time at the camp, \"especially with my Mum as head chef\".  Fiyaz Mughal OBE, who now works in community cohesion, said the lessons of dealing with refugees still needed to be learnt, especially given the situation faced by Ukrainian refugees trying to get into the UK. \"I think the bureaucracy, the fact that security overrides asylum, so 'let's check your background, have you got a bill' when people are running away from Ukraine, is ludicrous,\" he said. Britain he said, had   and that it had had a responsibility to help the Ugandan Asians after Amin \"turned\" and was not the person they thought they could do deals with.  \"But let's also be honest, Britain didn't just open its arms to us and say, immediately come in, it took public pressure to get them to take us in, so yes, they did the right thing in the end\". eastofenglandnews@bbc.co.uk \u00a9 2022 BBC.

Shortly afterwards, at the age of 12, he moved into a monastery in Thailand to start living as a Theravada Buddhist monk. It was to be the start of a disciplined way of life where he must follow 227 rules - also called precepts. He does not celebrate his birthday. He cannot watch TV, go to the cinema, ride a bike, run, drive a car, eat food after noon - or visit a football stadium. Now aged 37 and living as the head monk in an Edinburgh Buddhist temple, he has spoken to BBC Scotland in a rare interview about his life. \"When I was a child I saw Manchester United playing on a TV and I still remember the goalkeeper, Peter Schmeichel,\" he says. \"I dream of going to Old Trafford to watch them play, but I know I never will because we are not allowed to go there as monks. \"As a human being we have the same feelings as everyone else, but we know how to control ourselves and our minds.\" His strict way of living means he has rarely seen his parents or siblings since he was a young boy. Phra Prasert is the middle child of seven siblings. He was brought up on his parents' rice and buffalo farm in Sri Sa Kat Province in Thailand. When his older siblings left home, he worked around the farm and helped take care of his younger brothers and sisters. \"I felt I should be playing football with friends and other things like that, but because I was the eldest of the remaining children I had to do many things such as cooking and cleaning,\" he recalls. At the age of 11 he told his parents he wanted to join a monastery and train as a monk to make them proud. When he was 12, he was sent away to study in another province hundreds of miles away from home. \"I didn't speak to or see my family for three years. I didn't know the way back to the farm,\" he said. \"In my room I thought I am not going to cry and wrote on a piece of paper 'I can do it', which I pinned to my wall and read every day. \"I wanted my parents to be proud of me.\" He started his training while still living with his parents a year before he moved into the monastery. His Buddhist master told him then that one of the rules he would have to follow was that he was not allowed to touch women. As a result, he and his mother, Muang Prommala, kept a respectful distance between them at their home. But it was not until many years later that he realised that this rule did not completely apply to his mother. \"I realised I had misunderstood and that as Buddhist monks we can touch our mums in certain circumstances. \"When she is ill or in a dangerous situation I am allowed to touch her so I can help her.\" But 25 years later he still has not touched, embraced or even brushed past his mother. Phra Prasert is now the head monk of the Dhammapadipa Temple in the Slateford area of Edinburgh. He walks at the nearby Water of Leith and spends time being mindful, touching tree bark and leaves. \"Nature helps with my strength of mind. \"We are from nature so it is good to go back to nature,\" he says. But despite living such a disciplined life, he says he is happy and enjoys serving his local community in Scotland. Phra Prasert was invited to live in Scotland by the head monk at the Slateford temple after hearing he had a very good reputation. Phra Prasert agreed to come for two years on a trial. He then decided to stay on in Scotland - becoming head monk when the previous one was promoted to a temple in Leeds. He has lived in Edinburgh for the last seven years. He sleeps on the floor with no bed or mat and is not allowed to watch television. But he has found a modern way to feel close to his frail mother - by having CCTV cameras fitted throughout her farmhouse in Thailand. His father, Chey Prommala, died 10 years ago from diabetes. \"I don't feel homesick because I'm used to it and technology really helps,\" added Phra Prasert. \"I speak to my mum every day now and can see her from a mobile phone which is linked up to cameras in her house. \"She is unwell so it makes me feel better that I can keep an eye on her when I live so far away.\" \u00a9 2022 BBC.

Oleksii and his wife Anastasiya threw a Molotov cocktail at a Russian armoured vehicle driving through their city. They immediately went into hiding.    \"We knew Russians would be searching for us,\" says Anastasiya. \"We tried not to use our phones, so we couldn't be tracked. But when we turned them on, we saw hundreds of messages with threats from strangers, saying they would hang us, they would burn us with our own Molotov cocktails. It was an absolute nightmare.\" Russian state TV reported on the couple's actions, and revealed their identities. On the same day their birth dates, home addresses, telephone numbers, tax information, social media accounts and even their car's number plate were posted on Telegram, in a pro-Kremlin channel called \"Work, brothers\". The account has more than 46,000 subscribers.  The Telegram post called Oleksii, who used to be a member of the right-wing organisation \"Right Sector\", and Anastasiya \"Nazis\", an insult often thrown at Ukrainians by Russian state media.   The couple would sometimes receive more than 1,000 offensive messages a day.  \"All my social media accounts were full of abuse. I tried not to read them,\" recalls Anastasiya.  \"Where are the pictures of your dead bodies?\" read one of the messages. Another said: \"We know where you live.\"  \"It was terrifying,\" says Anastasiya, \"When you go to bed you can't sleep because you're listening to every noise, wondering if somebody has come for you.\"  After two months in hiding, they managed to escape to Ukrainian-controlled territory. The BBC has found that the \"Work, brothers\" channel and another pro-Russian channel - \"Tribunal\" - has shared the private data of almost 300 Ukrainian activists, soldiers and their relatives, to more than 120,000 subscribers.  Both channels were created on 1 March 2022; the sixth day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Alongside private information, the channels regularly promote Russian disinformation and pro-Kremlin narratives. Oleksandr, a Ukrainian soldier currently fighting on the front line in eastern Ukraine, recalls how in August he discovered that a video of his battalion destroying a Russian armoured vehicle was posted on Telegram, alongside his date of birth, phone number and email address. The post was published in \"Work, brothers\", and said that Oleksandr's family was living in Nova Kakhovka, a town in the Kherson region, which is occupied by Russian troops.  \"In the texts that I received, they called me a 'bloody khokhol' [a derogatory Russian term for Ukrainians] and threatened to find my mum and sister in Nova Kahovka and rape them,\" said Oleksandr. His mother died in 2015 and his sister had moved to Turkey seven years ago.  His home address was also published. Soon afterwards, his flat was broken into and his possessions stolen.  The BBC has tracked down some of those closely associated with the Telegram channels.  Olesya Orlenko, 41, from Moscow, describes herself as a historian and journalist. She was one of the founders of an online project called \"Tribunal\", which runs a website and the Telegram channel we have been monitoring. In the past she has promoted this work on Russian state media.  Ms Orlenko claims she is no longer associated with Tribunal, but uses familiar Kremlin narratives when describing the objectives of the project. \"It was created to collect information about Ukrainian Nazis [a term used by Russian state media] who committed crimes during the conflict in Donbas [in eastern Ukraine], so that later this information could be used by Russian or international courts,\"  she said. She denied she had anything to do with the sharing of soldiers' personal details. However, she was still one of those in charge of Tribunal when the doxxing started on its Telegram channel.  The BBC has also contacted one of the administrators of the chat group associated with the channel \"Work, brothers\". Tatyana is 39 and an office worker from Podolsk in the Moscow region. She told the BBC that in her free time she \"helps 'Work, brothers' as a volunteer\". She denied seeing Ukrainian soldiers' personal information and threats on the channel. We sent Tatyana a screenshot with a profile of a Ukrainian soldier and her comments below the post. She stopped replying to us.  \"These channels break Telegram's terms of service because they promote violence in a systematic way\", says Julia Smirnova, a senior analyst at Institute for Strategic Dialogue focused on disinformation and online hate speech.  \"They call for 'punishing' people whose data they publish, use hateful terms and slurs to describe them,\" says Ms Smirnova. \"The channels also publish posts that celebrate killings of Ukrainian military personnel or violence against people supporting the Ukrainian army.\" Telegram prohibits the promotion of violence on public channels. It also has an in-app reporting feature where users can flag violence and shared personal details. Remi Vaughn, Telegram's spokesperson, told the BBC that the company \"actively moderates\" the publication of private data and \"diligently removes\" content that breaches its terms of service.  To test this, we used the in-app feature to report 50 posts which included the personal information of Ukrainian soldiers and comments with clear calls for violence. A week later the posts and comments remained online.  This comes as no surprise to Viktor, another Ukrainian solider who had previously experienced harassment online for being an LGBT+ activist.  \"I always reported such things to Telegram, but I've never heard back from them. There was no reaction at all,\" he says. Earlier this year, his personal details and pictures were again posted on Telegram. There were death threats in the comments, but what really angered him was that this time the abuse went further, and targeted his family.  \"They shared addresses of my parents and even of my granny. They texted my sister. They even posted her address in Mykulichi that was occupied by Russians.\"   The village is near Bucha, where dozens of civilians were killed by Russian troops.   \"It's good they posted it after the village was liberated. But what if they did it earlier?\" says Viktor. \"There were real cases when relatives of Ukrainian soldiers were shot dead. These people [who share it] and Telegram itself should be held to account.\" \u00a9 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. "},

It is no surprise that climate anxiety is rising, particularly among young people, who have mostly only known a world affected by climate change. But experts and activists have told BBC News that these fears can actually be good news for the planet. \"People are who really aware of climate change may be more motivated to take action,\" University of Bath environmental psychologist Prof Lorraine Whitmarsh says. Her research has found a   including reducing carbon footprint by cutting down on waste or buying second-hand. When people talk about their own climate anxiety, they often say it is linked to the vast amounts of negative and often scary news about the planet. \"I think it's hard not to worry about climate change. We're constantly bombarded with news articles and social media about how it's just crisis after crisis - ice caps melting, disasters - it can be very overwhelming,\" explains Roisin, 16, from County Antrim in Northern Ireland. Roisin is on the youth advisory board of Save The Children, which recently found that   they are inheriting.  But she says there is hope too: \"You can always see young activists like Greta Thunberg, and people like David Attenborough taking action on it.\" Roisin says she has become a vegetarian and makes sure she only shops locally. \"Taking action is my only way of dealing with climate anxiety - it means I know I've done everything I can do to solve the problem,\" she says. Some campaigners, like 23-year-old Zahra Biabani in California, say the widespread focus on climate catastrophe can be misleading.  When she began posting online about environmental issues at university, she realised there was \"a gap between education and action, which was being filled by 'doomism'\". \"Climate education can be debilitating without a form of encouragement to act, especially when we see what's going on the world, and how it's going to get worse,\" she explains.   Now she shares \"climate optimist\" news and writes newsletters focusing on good news and solutions. \"Climate optimism is not just nice, it's necessary because in order to be sustained in our action and our advocacy, we need to believe in and have something that's worth fighting for,\" she explains.  She believes that there is a generational divide between many young people who want to focus on how the planet could be saved, and the \"older white man community\" that focuses on how \"the world is going to end\".  \"I don't want to think this comes from a bad place. I think they have a lot of anxiety as well, but they're finding a very different way to use it,\" she suggests.  Psychotherapist Caroline Hickman specialises in climate anxiety, and has treated a significant number of young people. She says it is \"totally normal\" to worry about the state of the planet, but \"sinking into despair and 'climate doomism' is not the solution\". It is important to distinguish between serious clinical anxiety about climate change, which is a mental health issue, and worries or concerns.  Prof Whitmarsh suggests that while there are high levels of concern about climate change, particularly in young people, most people do not have debilitating climate anxiety that requires treatment by a mental health professional.

In the past year, violence has increased once more as security forces battle against more than 100 armed groups in the east of the country, despite the presence of a large United Nations peacekeeping operation. Both the M23 and the Congolese army have accused each other of starting the clashes leading to the current crisis. The intensity of the escalation has been such that President F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi issued a call to arms on Thursday. He urged the country's youth to \"organise themselves into vigilance groups\" to support the army. The affects of the conflict are not restricted to DR Congo, but are also souring diplomatic relations between Rwanda and DR Congo, which accuses its neighbour of backing the M23 rebels and even expelled the Rwandan ambassador last week. Rwanda denies the claims The M23, which was formed a decade ago, claims to defend the interests of ethnic Tutsis living in DR Congo against Hutu militias.  Rwanda's President Paul Kagame came to power at the head of a rebel Tutsi army fighting Hutu extremists who slaughtered hundreds of thousands of ethnic Tutsis during the 1994 genocide. Many of those responsible then fled to DR Congo after Mr Kagame's forces took over in Rwanda, taking the conflict across the border with them. In an attempt to ease the latest crisis, leaders of the East Africa Community (EAC) agreed to send a force to quell the fighting in eastern DR Congo, just months after that country joined the regional grouping.  There is no specific figure on the number of troops that will be deployed. What we know so far is that only four countries - Kenya, Uganda, South Sudan, and Burundi - are sending their soldiers.  One thousand Kenyan troops will join their Burundi counterparts who arrived in DR Congo in early August for the joint mission against the rebels. It is not clear if Tanzania will deploy troops. Military officials have declined to reveal the numbers of soldiers involved, citing security and strategic reasons.  Burundian soldiers are currently based at Luberezi near Bukavu in South Kivu. The Kenyan contingent will be stationed near Goma in North Kivu and will command the East African Community Regional Force. Rwanda is also a member of the EAC but it has been agreed it should not contribute to the regional force. M23 rebels have seized several towns in eastern DR Congo and have gained further ground in recent weeks but they are not the only group the East African force will be fighting in the three most troubled provinces - North Kivu, South Kivu and Ituri.  The different contingents will each have distinct missions. Kenyan soldiers will focus on rebels in the North Kivu area where some of their counterparts are already embedded in the UN force.  Ugandan troops will pursue the Allied Democratic Forces who are linked to the Islamic State in North Kivu and Ituri, and have  . Burundian troops will concentrate in South Kivu, where they will battle the Tabara milita. South Sudanese forces will fight remnants of the Lord Resistance's Army.  The role of the East Africa regional force is clearly defined as targeting armed groups. The UN has had a peacekeeping mission in DR Congo since 2000 and was previously limited to protecting civilians and supporting operations of the Congolese army.  However, the UN later approved the creation of a combat force with the mandate of carrying out targeted offensive operations to pacify armed groups in the region.  The intervention brigade is comprised of troops from South Africa, Tanzania, and Malawi. Many Congolese are strongly critical of the UN mission, known as Monusco, accusing its 13,000 troops of failing to protect them against the rebels. Earlier this year, there were deadly protests against the UN and these have resumed in recent days as the M23 has advanced. Security analysts says the East African force and Monusco will need to coordinate closely if they are to be effective.  Kenya has been instrumental in trying to broker a permanent peace deal between DR Congo and the rebels.  In July, former Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta - who played a key role in DR Congo joining the EAC in March - was appointed to facilitate peace talks and oversee the implementation of a peace deal the two sides had agreed in Nairobi.  Defence and security analysts say DR Congo has been lobbying Mr Kenyatta's successor, William Ruto, on the peace initiative and deployment of the regional force. As East Africa's most advanced economy, Kenya has been keen to advance its business ties across the region through trade and investment.  Eastern DR Congo is endowed with extraordinary natural wealth. Minerals have played a key role in more than three decades of armed conflict there.  Numerous rebel groups have funded their occupation of the region through exploiting minerals such as tin, tungsten, tantalum and gold. President Tshisekedi says that Rwanda wants to destabilise the region because it wants to appropriate its minerals, but Rwanda has denied any role in DR Congo's unrest. However, it did twice send its troops into its much larger neighbour in the 1990s - saying it was trying to to halt attacks by Hutu militias based there. This led to a conflict which ultimately drew in the armies from seven African states. A report by a UN panel of experts in 2002 revealed that criminals linked to the security forces of Uganda, Rwanda, Zimbabwe and DR Congo had all benefited from exploiting that country's minerals.

{"Link": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-63405911", "Text": "It is easy to classify the war in Cameroon's English-speaking regions of North-West and South-West as a clash over language. What this conflict really embodies, however, is a battle for fairness and access. When I accompanied my uncle and his daughter in 2016 to check her medical school entrance results, I knew she would not make it.  At the entrance of a campus in Bamenda - the main city in the North-West region - were hundreds of science students, who had all passed their A-Levels, scrambling to find their names on the notice board. Most of them had not made it. Some were bemused, others cried, some laughed about it. Together, they were all sharing their first real experience of living as English-speaking Cameroonians.  The odds were stacked against my cousin - and against all English-speaking Cameroonian candidates - trying to get into a government-run medical school. It was a stark example of their marginalisation by Cameroon's French-speaking majority. The medical school entrance paper my cousin sat was in English - with questions often poorly translated from French making some of them incomprehensible and marked by those who are not proficient in English. So very few English-speaking students are accepted. It effectively bars many English speakers from attending state-run universities, where students receive subsidised tuition. It is also common to hear allegations of bribery, which is rife throughout Cameroon, with wealthy parents \"buying\" a place for their child.  We were just one of the many families going through disappointment in Cameroon's Anglophone zone - and by November 2016 the demands for education, judicial and other reforms escalated into calls for a two-state federation. It later erupted into a secessionist war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives. The prevailing system means there are fewer doctors from North-West and South-West Cameroon practising at home. Even for the Francophone doctors who speak English, it is hard for them to relate to a culture and environment they were not raised in.   Those I have met are dedicated to their work, but sometimes it takes more than desire to apply medicine. Medics at a hospital in the North-West region told me about a man who had surgery for testicular cancer and went home believing he was cured. His French-speaking doctor could not get it across that he had to return for a follow-up. He only came back when he started feeling pain. The man died.  In rural areas, for example, not everyone can speak lingua francas like English or Pidgin.  I once interviewed a woman in my village for an article I was writing about cataracts. She only spoke Lamnso, with which I am familiar but not fluent, so I employed a translator to put us both at ease. The fact that she did not consider me an outsider also allowed her to talk freely about her eye surgery and encourage others to try it.  Some health professionals believe the government's push to improve issues in the medical field has borne fruit over the last six years.  There are now two functioning government-run medical schools in the two English-speaking regions - there was only one when my cousin applied - and an oversight committee to implement reforms. Students also report better translations of exam questions but nothing near professional standards. Trainers say more is being done to improve the cultural awareness of doctors and they are seeing more English-speaking Cameroonians in their classrooms than they ever met when in medical school themselves. While medicine may be slowly starting to improve, there is a lot more to achieve in public life. Many Anglophones feel that French has been used as a language of intimidation from the earliest days of the union between French Cameroon and what was British-controlled territory. And since the uprising began, many more French-speaking police officers have been sent to patrol the streets of Bamenda, where they constantly check IDs. They get angry if someone cannot speak French, demand money at roadblocks and sometimes force young women to share their phone numbers. When I go around Bamenda with those fluent in administrative French, we have no bother with such harassment. I am in awe of the way their use of French gives me a pass in my hometown. The challenge for Anglophones is that we simply cannot hide.  While studying biochemistry at the University of Yaound\u00e9, I - like many English-speaking students - never bothered asking questions in class because of the abuse we got. Some Francophone students and even lecturers would hurl insults when they heard English or picked up the accent in our well-rehearsed French. Thousands in state-run universities have to buy translated notes or pay for extra classes in English to compensate.  Our parents are often humiliated by French-speaking civil servants when they have to travel to Yaound\u00e9 to chase up their unpaid pensions, victims of bureaucracy that seems intent on cheating them. Set texts for Anglophone schools, chosen by the government, are often poorly edited and written - leading to falling standards. Yet it is ironic that in spite of the conflict prestigious private Anglophone schools have become sought-after by affluent Cameroonian parents who cannot speak a word of English themselves.  They understand that the best opportunities will eventually go to graduates immersed in both cultures, speaking flawless English and French. A graduate who was raised speaking French at home while studying in English from nursery school is a formidable asset. They are the perfect fit for scholarships and international jobs in bodies like the UN.  Even during a war that was triggered by discrimination, they are the right fit for global organisations trying to wade through Cameroonian bureaucracy.  Some English-speakers see this influx as an opportunity for their children to learn French, but others are uneasy about the change. With a focus on those who can pay fees upfront - and can extend generous donations - English-speakers are finding it more difficult to go to these schools.  Until the late 1990s some parents in English-speaking areas, like my mother, still paid fees in instalments or with food crops like beans, maize and vegetables. Their children got an education and the food was used to feed students. The reality now is that the vast majority of children in the conflict-hit areas have gone from receiving a sub-standard education to little or no education at all.  Would-be students with too much time on their hands have turned to crime, scamming and the all-too-easy life that bitcoin trading promises. At a time when they should be at school, many teenage girls are raising babies from unplanned pregnancies and rape. Back in 2016, after months of anguish, my uncle took out a huge loan and sent my cousin to Uganda to pursue her dream as she could not do it in her own country - and when she qualifies she may opt not to return home. The war is now also driving many healthcare workers, teachers and students away, a trend that will have dire consequences for the region and the economy.  But what most in the English-speaking regions want - from those calling for federalism to those wanting secession - is to live in a country where their children will not have to start life with an insurmountable handicap.

That tops the previous record of $1.59bn, split between three Powerball players in 2016. The odds of winning the jackpot are one in 292 million, according to Powerball. The game, which began in 1992, is played in 45 of the 50 US states, the capital city of Washington, and in the US territories of Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. A ticket must match all six numbers drawn to score the jackpot - and there has been no winner in 39 consecutive drawings. Whoever holds the golden ticket has the option of receiving the full amount in an annuity paid over three decades. But almost all winners instead opt for the upfront cash option, where they can receive a smaller amount as a lump sum. The cash prize for Saturday night's draw is currently estimated at $782.4m (\u00a3688m). That's a big step up from the last successful jackpot in early August, when a ticket buyer in Pennsylvania had to make do with a relatively modest $206.9m. History's biggest ever lottery draw to date saw three Powerball ticket holders in three different US states share the spoils in 2016. The winners - John and Lisa Robinson from Tennessee; Maureen Smith and David Kaltschmidt from Florida; and Marvin and Mae Acosta from California - opted for lump-sum payments of roughly $327.8m. The Robinsons, who bought the golden ticket and three more tickets at a local grocery store, told NBC News' Today show that they had opted for cash because \"we're not guaranteed tomorrow\". Ms Smith and Mr Kaltschmidt told NBC they would be retiring early, and spending the money on getting massages and replacing their aging truck. \u00a9 2022 BBC.

A suspect, said to be a local resident, has been arrested.

The two miners were stranded nearly 200 metres (650 feet) underground after part of the zinc mine they were working in collapsed on 26 October in Bonghwa, in the east of the country.

It marks the first time in its 50-year history that the RN has not been led by a member of the Le Pen family.  But the move does not mark a major change in direction for the party.  Marine Le Pen remains the source of real power and she is still the likely candidate in the next presidential election in 2027.  She told the party on Saturday that she was not disappearing from politics.  \"I am not leaving RN to take a holiday. I will be there where the country needs me,\" she said at the party convention.  Brought up in a poor family of Italian origin in the Paris suburbs, Mr Bardella joined the far-right as a teenager and rose quickly to the top of the party, becoming its acting president last year. He ran the RN's successful 2019 European election campaign, and has since impressed even his enemies with his assertiveness in debates.  He is seen as loyal to Ms Le Pen, telling AFP news agency recently that he is a \"continuity candidate with the aim of building on the incredible legacy that Marine is handing over\".  His elevation to the party's senior leadership is part of the RN's efforts to soften its image and attract younger voters.  Like Ms Le Pen he likes to portray himself as a new type of nationalist who has little in common with the racism and anti-Semitism of the party's predecessor, the National Front.  However, critics say that these sentiments still exist within the party.  In the most recent controversy, a RN lawmaker was suspended for two weeks from the National Assembly   while a black member of parliament was speaking. Ms Le Pen stepped down as leader of the party last year so she could focus on her presidential bid, which she eventually lost in April in a run-off to President Emmanuel Macron.  Despite the defeat, she fronted the party's parliamentary election campaign two months later in which the RN won 89 seats - a 10-fold rise and the party's best-ever showing.

Twitter staff have been using the platform to talk about their dismissal. There are concerns Twitter could water down content moderation but Mr Musk said the firm's policies remain \"absolutely unchanged\". As reports emerged on Friday that thousands of staff at Twitter around the world were losing their jobs, questions were asked over the future of employees responsible for taking down harmful material. Online safety groups and campaigners have suggested Mr Musk might relax moderation policies, making Twitter less effective at removing hate-speech and disinformation from the platform.  Permanent Twitter bans given to controversial figures - including former president Donald Trump - could also be removed. The changes come shortly before the US midterms when a spike in disinformation is expected.  These concerns were fuelled by Mr Musk's comments on Friday, which sought to blame Twitter's \"massive drop in revenue\" on \"activist groups\" who were \"trying to destroy free speech in America\". Yoel Roth, Twitter's Head of Safety & Integrity,  He said the \"reduction in force\" affected around 15% of those working in Twitter's trust and safety organisation - compared with what he said was a 50% cut seen across the company, which has about 7,500 staff.  US President Joe Biden voiced his concern about the takeover on Friday, saying \"Elon Musk goes out and buys an outfit that sends - that spews lies all across the world... How do we expect kids to be able to understand what is at stake?\" An internal email sent to staff earlier on Friday said the mass job cuts were \"unfortunately necessary to ensure the company's success moving forward\". Staff confirmed on Twitter they had been logged out of work laptops and Slack, a messaging system. Many staff revealed that they had been axed in posts on the platform, painting a picture of cuts that spanned the globe and hit departments that ranged from marketing to engineering. They included communications, content curation and product development employees. Waiting for the news of job cuts, one worker wondered which would last longer, his Twitter employee login or a lettuce - a reference to a British newspaper's viral stunt asking the same question of former Prime Minister Liz Truss. My employee login   vs. Lettuce Let's goooooooooo  A host of major brands have halted advertising spending with Twitter, including Volkswagen, General Motors and Pfizer. Almost all of Twitter's revenue currently comes from advertising, and Mr Musk has been looking for ways to cut costs and make money in different ways from the platform, including plans to charge a monthly subscription fee for users to be verified on the platform. He also proposed that those paying the $8 per month fee would get their tweets boosted in replies, mentions, and searches, prompting criticism from some people on Twitter that he was creating a two-tier system that would benefit those willing to pay. Twitter employees filed a class action lawsuit on Thursday which argued the company was making big job cuts without giving 60 days' notice, in violation of federal and Californian law. \u00a9 2022 BBC.

One of them could have hit their vehicle at any moment. It was freezing and pitch dark, but at times the sky lit up with what looked like phosphorous weapons, illuminating the road ahead.  Mariana had been serving on the front line in Mariupol since the war began in February, but now the stakes were even higher than usual - she had discovered she was pregnant two weeks earlier.  The city was besieged by Russian forces, bombarded day and night, targeted relentlessly and indiscriminately with Russian missiles.  Her battalion was stationed at the Illich steel plant - one of the city's last Ukrainian holdouts. But the Russians were closing in, and travelling any distance from base meant risking death or capture. With no safe way of escaping the front line, Mariana had little choice but to stay with her unit despite her pregnancy, and hope for the best for her and her baby. But she was unlucky.  \"Our car was stopped and we were told: 'from this moment on you are prisoners of the Russian Federation',\" she told the BBC. \"'A step to the right, or a step to the left, and we shoot,' they said. \"I turned to the guys I was with and said 'tell me we're not being captured. Tell me they're not taking us prisoner!' I was so scared.\" But her worst fears had become reality. Mariana and her colleagues were transferred to a storage warehouse for three days before being taken to the Olenivka prison in the occupied part of eastern Ukraine.  The facility, notorious for its squalid conditions, abusive staff and chronically overcrowded rooms, was the site of a  . Both sides blame the attack on each other.  For Mariana, it was the start of a six-month ordeal during which she slept on the floor and was deprived of access to healthy food and fresh air. She was intimidated and threatened during interrogations and at one point prevented from using the toilet while nine-months pregnant. She was also terrified her baby would be born in captivity and taken from her. Soon after she was captured, she was questioned by a Russian official.  \"He said if I don't answer the way he needs me to, he'll send me to a camp in Russia and my baby will be taken away,\" Mariana said.  Her interrogator threatened to ensure that her child was transferred from one orphanage to another, making it impossible to ever track down.  \"It was really terrible, I cried so much,\" she said quietly.  At other times, barking dogs were used to intimidate Mariana into making false statements.  Throughout her ordeal, Mariana's medical training gave her reassurance that her pregnancy was developing normally. But conditions in the prison were poor. \"We lived in a small room meant for six people, but there were 40 women in there,\" she said.  \"The older women slept two or three in a bunk. I slept on the floor, underneath a bed with a friend. I had a couple of pillows and a blanket.\" Later, Mariana was transferred to a smaller room where she slept on a wooden pallet on the floor.  For the first few months, she was treated exactly the same as all the other female prisoners. But when she was seven-months pregnant, a doctor advised that she needed more fresh air and she was allowed to walk around the yard.  \"It depended on which guard was on shift though,\" she said. \"Sometimes I could spend half a day outside, other times they didn't let me out at all.\"  In July, she developed a complication and was taken to hospital for an ultrasound. It was Mariana's first glimpse of her baby.  \"I saw its little arms and legs. It unfurled its fist and showed me its five little fingers. I cried and cried. They told me the baby was fine, but it was very small and I need to eat more and take more vitamins.\" When she returned to the prison, some guards took pity on her and brought her home-cooked food and vitamins.  As Mariana entered the final weeks of her pregnancy, there was talk of a prisoner swap but still no sign of it happening.  Her husband Vasyl, frustrated at a perceived lack of urgency from the Ukrainian government in negotiating her release, appealed for her to be freed on humanitarian grounds. \"A mother and her children are sacred everywhere... Let them free her,\"  .  Mariana was transferred to a maternity ward in Donetsk where she was treated well, but the threat of being separated from her baby remained. Two possibilities emerged; either Mariana would be sent to a prison in Donetsk where she could live with her baby for as long as she was breastfeeding. Or she would be taken to a facility in Russia where her baby would be taken from her when it turned three. She was too scared to ask where her child would go in either scenario.  Mariana felt that an exchange was her last hope. But one Friday in September, she received the news she had been dreading.  \"They told me the exchange was off. The situation on the frontline had intensified, and the two sides couldn't agree. I understood it was the end,\" Mariana said. By then she could have given birth any day.  But over the weekend, something changed. Mariana doesn't know why but all of a sudden the swap was given the green light. The following Tuesday, she was transferred with dozens of other prisoners to a city in Russia near the Ukrainian border. There, she was blindfolded, her hands tied, and put on a military plane with other prisoners to a location in Belarus.  The journey took 20 hours but the Russian soldiers guarding Mariana refused to let her use the toilet, despite her being nine-months pregnant.  \"'Use this bottle,' they joked. I told them 'I won't be able to get it in' and 'I'm in pain'. But they just told me to hold it in,\" Mariana said with a resigned laugh.  From Belarus she was driven the short distance across to the border to Ukraine, and she was back in the relative safety of her homeland.  Just four days later, Mariana gave birth to a healthy baby girl called Anna. She weighed 3.2kg (7lb) - within the normal range.   As for the future, Mariana would like to continue working in medicine, but her husband has made his views clear.   \"He says he won't cope if I go back to the front line,\" she laughs. \"He said he'd leave me.\" For now, the couple are content adapting to their new life as a family.  \"I already got used to the fact that I have a little baby, who has completely changed my life,\" she said. \"I even had time to get used to the idea of being a mum. It's just unfortunate that I had to do that in prison.\" \u00a9 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. "},

Mr Putin said people living in dangerous areas should leave as \"the civilian population should not suffer\". At least 70,000 people are reported to have been moved already from Kherson - the only major city gained by Moscow since its troops invaded in February. Civilians at risk from shelling and attacks should be \"removed\", Mr Putin said, during the Unity Day holiday in Moscow's Red Square. Kyiv accuses Russia of forcibly deporting Ukrainian civilians - which is considered a war crime - although Moscow denies this. Russia's intensive missile and drone strikes on civilian infrastructure across Ukraine have caused heavy casualties and damage, and forced Kyiv to impose frequent electricity blackouts. Mr Putin's comments followed reports on Thursday that Russian soldiers, too, had been leaving Kherson - in what would mark a major withdrawal.  A Kremlin-installed official in the region, Kirill Stremousov, told Russian media that Moscow was \"likely\" to pull its troops from the area. Ukrainian officials remained cautious, warning that the reported move could be a trap to lure their soldiers into dangerous areas.  Kherson was captured soon after Russia attacked its neighbour on 24 February, but recently Ukrainian forces have steadily recaptured territory on the city's outskirts.  Civilians were first urged to leave Kherson in the middle of last month, as the Russian army switched the city to defensive mode. Military commanders later said they had  , ahead of an expected battle there.  Russia claims the Kherson region and three other Ukrainian regions as its own territory, though it does not fully control any of them. It hastily arranged local \"referendums\" to justify the claim - a move condemned internationally. Russia also annexed Ukraine's Crimea peninsula in 2014. During Friday's speech in Red Square, Mr Putin also said some 318,000 military recruits had signed up for duty during a mobilisation, now complete - exceeding his target of 300,000. Of these, Mr Putin said 49,000 were already involved in active fighting - a figure not independently verified by the BBC.  In its latest update, Britain's Ministry of Defence said the latest recruits would make little impact on the conflict as Russia would struggle to train them.  Meanwhile, a Russian private military company, the Wagner Group, has opened its first official headquarters, in St Petersburg. Its fighters are reported to be active in the Russian campaign in Ukraine, and it has recruited prisoners to fight there, in exchange for their sentences being commuted in Russia.  Wagner soldiers have repeatedly been accused of human rights violations, including in Syria, Libya and other conflicts. Mr Putin has now   on calling up reservists to include men convicted of serious crimes who recently left prison. The change means that convicted murderers and drug dealers who have recently been released could be conscripted to fight in Ukraine. Former prisoners convicted of sex crimes against children or terrorism are still excluded from serving. In his latest comments on the war, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky attacked the \"absolutely insane stubbornness of the owners of today's Russia\". He said his enemy was uninterested in peace talks, but was instead sending \"people to the meat grinder\" - both mobilised troops and mercenary fighters. Referring to the week's \"fiercest fighting\", Mr Zelensky singled out the eastern towns of Bakhmut and Soledar. \u00a9 2022 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. "},

You need one to watch live TV on any channel or device, and BBC programmes on iPlayer. It\u2019s the law.   Edited by Paulin Kola All times stated are UK We will be focusing our coverage today on the state of   - one of the key states in the midterms race.  President  , as well as former presidents   and  , are all on the campaign trail in Pennsylvania today. Trump will hold a rally backing Republican Senate candidate   at 19:00 ET (23:00 GMT) in the city of Latrobe. Meanwhile, Obama will be at a Get Out the Vote rally with President Biden to support Democrat governor candidate   and Senate candidate   Biden is expected to speak around 17:00 ET.  , Democrat candidate for governor, is also scheduled to host a rally on Saturday with American singer John Legend.  The outcome of Pennsylvania's Senate race could determine if the Democrats will maintain control over the upper chamber of the US Congress, or if it will tilt in favour of the Republicans - a tilt that could impact President Biden's agenda, as the Senate is crucial for making and passing laws in the US.  So far, polls show Oz and Fetterman to be neck-and-neck among voters - each polling around 46%. Close contests have become the norm in Pennsylvania. The last two presidential elections were each decided by barely 1% - and this year\u2019s Senate race could also come down to the wire. Sarah Smith Reporting from Jeckyll Island, Georgia In\nGeorgia they love \u201cshrimp and grits\u201d so much they have an entire weekend\nfestival devoted to the traditional southern dish. It's a good place to get a taste\nfor how voters are feeling about the midterm elections in this key state. I was surprised to find that most people queuing\nup to get their grits were not deterred from voting for Hershel Walker by the\nclaims from two ex-girlfriends that he had pressured them into having abortions\n- despite his public stance in favour of banning abortion without exceptions.\nClaims that Walker has denied. Brian (pictured) said the story didn\u2019t bother him\nas Walker had said it wasn\u2019t true. Dorothy, who calls herself a \u201cproud MAGA\nRepublican\u201d, voted for Walker because, she said, he is a changed man since he\ncame to God.  Other Republican voters dismissed the scandal as\nlies or fake news. \u201cYou don't know what to believe when everyone is smearing\neveryone else,\u201d said Jeremy Bower. The economy, inflation and the price of gas was\nwhat most voters said really mattered to them. With many of them directly\nblaming President Joe Biden for rising prices. I can also report that shrimp and grits taste a\nlot better than they sound. While President Joe Biden isn\u2019t on the ballot, the upcoming midterms will decide who controls Congress as well as state legislatures and governors\u2019 offices. The outcome of these races can have a huge impact on the direction the US takes in the next few years, as well as on the fate of the president - and the party - in power. If control of one of the two chambers of Congress goes to the Republicans, Biden will likely be thwarted in his attempts to get bills and laws passed. You can expect to see gridlock. Both parties have proposed nationwide laws concerning abortion rights if they are in control of Congress after the midterms. At a state level, the results of governor and local races could mean further abortion restrictions in some states. Some Republicans have vowed to close the committee investigating the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, and launch hearings of their own into Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter and his business ties to China if they win control of the House of Representatives. Read more about why the midterms matter  The Federal Reserve  for the sixth time this year on Wednesday, in a bid to reduce inflation - an issue on the minds of many Americans, and which has now become a hot topic in these midterms. The cost of food in the US is rising at the fastest pace since the 1970s, with grocery prices up 13.5% in the 12 months to September - and wages are failing to keep pace. Shoppers across the country are feeling the pain. The Republicans are running with it as one of their key talking points to attack the Democrats. However, for the Democratic base, polls suggest that inflation concerns have been overshadowed by the fight over abortion, which returned to the spotlight after the Supreme Court struck down the constitutional right to abortion in June. There are also worries about democracy generally, which some attribute to former president Donald Trump's involvement in politics. For Republicans, the economy remains key, especially as the price of gasoline - which can loom larger than food price hikes in the public imagination - has started to tick higher after dropping this summer. But Republican candidates are also focused on issues that appeal to their base, like immigration. Let's take a look at some key states that could swing Congress for the Democrats or the Republicans. We'll be bringing you on-the-ground reporting from these battleground states as we continue to count down to the midterms. : In 2020, President Joe Biden became the first Democratic presidential nominee to win Arizona since Bill Clinton, who won the state in 1996. The governor race in Arizona pits Trump-backed Republican and former TV news anchor Kari Lake against Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who rose to national prominence for fighting back against Trump\u2019s claims of election fraud. Two years ago, Biden became the first Democrat to win Georgia since 1992.The race is expected to be a close-run affair as Democrat Raphael Warnock goes up against Trump-backed football star Herschel Walker, who is standing on a strongly anti-abortion platform, despite claims from two women that Biden won Michigan in 2020, after Donald Trump became the first Republican to win the state since 1988. Democratic Governor Gretchen Whitmer faces conservative commentator Tudor Dixon, who has the backing of Donald Trump. The outcome of certain governor and local races could affect abortion laws in some states. : In the race for governor, the state\u2019s attorney general, Democrat Josh Shapiro, is facing off against Doug Mastriano, a state senator backed by Donald Trump. The winner will be able to choose the state\u2019s election officials for 2024 and can block - or advance - voting restrictions in the state. With only four days to go until the midterm elections, current and former presidents are out campaigning for Democratic and Republican candidates across the country. President  , as well as former presidents   and  , are focusing their efforts on  - one of the key states in the midterms race. Trump will hold a rally backing Republican candidate Mehmet Oz at 19:00 ET (23:00 GMT) in the city of Latrobe.  Obama is also in Pennslyvania and will be at the Get Out the Vote rally alongside President Biden backing gubernatorial candidate Josh Shapiro, and senatorial candidate John Fetterman. Biden is expected to speak around 17:00 ET (21:00 GMT) Meanwhile, former President   will be campaigning for Governor Kathy Hochul in  , and  will attend an  Education Association campaign rally and will go on the campaign trail with Senator Mark Kelly. Echoing President Biden's remarks, the US House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, spoke to grassroots activists last night in California and said that the midterms race is \"very winnable\".   Pelosi also said that the Democrats' efforts are aimed not only at winning the election but also at strengthening the American democracy: \"There is no question that our democracy is on the ballot,\u201d she said. This was the first appearance Pelosi has made since her husband was attacked at the couple's San Francisco home by an intruder who was reportedly carrying zip ties, tape and a rope in a backpack and hit him on the head with a hammer after asking where \"Nancy\" was. Pelosi said that the attack on her husband highlighted the \"fear\" felt by poll workers and other Americans in the heated political climate ahead of next week's midterm elections.  Addressing her husband's injuries, Pelosi said that \"it's going to be a long haul,\" but that he \"will be well.\" She added: \"People say to me: \u2018What can I do to make you feel better?\u2019 I say: \u2018Vote!\u2019\u201d Pelosi told those on the video call on Friday. On Friday night, President Biden attended a Chicago-area fundraiser for two Democratic Representatives at risk of losing their seats if Republicans do well in midterm elections on Tuesday. Biden told donors he is \"not buying the notion that we\u2019re in big trouble\". However, forecasts show Republicans are poised to take control of the US House of Representatives and perhaps the Senate as well, which would give them the power to block Biden's legislative agenda for the next two years. This would be in line with historical trends that show that the ruling party normally loses control of Congress during the first half of a new president's term. But Biden remained positive, saying that he thought Democrats might buck the trend this time: \"We're going to win this time around. I feel really good about our chances.\" Biden's campaign swing will conclude with a joint appearance in Philadelphia on Saturday with former President Barack Obama. Welcome to our live coverage of the run-up to next week's midterm elections.  We will bring you all the latest developments as current and former presidents join the campaigning efforts on either side of the Democratic and Republican divide.  Do stay with us.             The Democrat in a key US Senate race hoped to prove he'd recovered from a stroke. It did not go well.

Randy Jo Sa'ah BBC News, Yaound\u00e9 Africa's oldest president and one of the continent's longest serving rulers - President Paul Biya - will mark 40 years in power this weekend.  Nationwide commemorative activities have been planned and his supporters are celebrating his achievements.  But the 89-year-old's opponents are lukewarm, calling on him to step down and hand over power to a younger generation.  Mr Biya\u2019s long rule has been characterised by great ambition but also with significant failures.

BBC Focus on Africa radio Top officials in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo have traded accusations on the BBC's flagship radio programme for Africa following . \"President Tshisekedi called youth to join the army because the country is under threat - we are experiencing a new aggression from Rwanda,\" said DR Congo government spokesman and media minister Patrick Muyaya. But the president's push for so-called vigilance groups is \"cheap populism\", \"dangerous\" and little more than an irresponsible \"election tactic\", according to Rwanda's government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo. She also dismissed DR Congo's accusations that Rwanda is supporting the M23 rebel group, alleging that \"most of the groups in the DRC [were] actually started and sponsored by Congolese politicians\" and saying that DR Congo should not try to blame other nations when it has \"failed to bring security to its [own] citizens\".

What impact will they have? By Reality Check team BBC News There were a number of claims made about the asylum system at Prime Minister's Questions. North Korea has been conducting more and more missile tests as part of its weapons development programme. Reality Check Asked what the government was doing about speeding up the\nprocessing of asylum claims, the prime minister said: \u201cWe\u2019ve increased the\nnumber of processing officials by 80%\u201d. Home Office official Abi Tierney told a committee of MPs a\nweek ago that they had increased the number of asylum decision makers by 584 to\n1,073, which is an increase of 119%, although neither she nor the prime\nminister gave a time period. In the same session, David Neal, independent chief inspector\nof borders and immigration, said the figure for decision makers was 1,090, with\nanother 139 coming online in November. Mr Neal\u2019s   from last year put the\nnumber of decision makers in March 2021 at just under 600. If that has now been\nincreased to 1,090 that would be an increase of about 80%.   We have asked the Home Office where the 80% figure came\nfrom. Reality Check At Prime Minister's Questions, Conservative MP Scott Benton said that taxpayers face \u201ca bill of \u00a35.6m per day\u201d to accommodate \u201cnearly 40,000 illegal immigrants who crossed the Channel this year\u201d. We\u2019ve heard that figure before from Abi Tierney, director general for customer services capability at the Home Office. She told a committee of MPs a week ago that the cost of hotel accommodation for asylum seekers was \u00a35.6m a day, although that was the figure for all asylum seekers, not just those who had arrived in small boats. It\u2019s also not just for those who arrived this year - we know that only 4% of those who arrived in small boats in 2021 have had an asylum decision. Ms Tierney said that on top of that, \u00a31.2m per day is spent on hotel accommodation for people brought over from Afghanistan, bringing the bill to a total of \u00a36.8m a day. Reality Check Labour leader Keir Starmer asked the prime minister how many asylum claims from those who arrived in the UK on small boats last year had been processed.  Rishi Sunak didn't give a figure in his reply but Mr Starmer  .  This is correct.

By Peter Mwai BBC Reality Check We've been investigating an air strike against one target in Tirgray. By Reality Check team BBC News Looking at claims about police numbers, nurses and fracking. Reality Check During Prime Minister's Questions, Rishi Sunak said there were \u201c3,500 more\ndoctors and over 9,000 more nurses working this year than last\u201d. He\u2019s got his numbers about right. There were about 4,000\nmore community and hospital doctors, and 9,230 more nurses and health visitors\nworking in the NHS in England in June 2022 ( ) compared\nwith the previous June. That\u2019s an increase of about\n3% each. However, NHS data suggests  slightly since last year. That might mean there are more staff coming on board, but\npossibly not fast enough to keep up with growing demand. Reality Check During PMQs a little earlier, Sunak said to Starmer: \u201cI\nwould hope he would welcome the news today that there are over 15,000 new\npolice officers on our streets.\u201d The Conservative Party manifesto in 2019 set a target to recruit 20,000 additional police officers in England and Wales by March 2023. That was an attempt to reverse the cuts in the period since 2010, when the number of officers had fallen by about 19,000. Today,\n  show that just over 15,300\nof those officers have been recruited. This means that police forces still have to recruit almost\n5,000 more officers to meet the Spring deadline. By Reality Check team BBC News How much pollution comes from festive fireworks, rather than farm fires, factories and other sources? Peter Mwai BBC Reality Check The latest information from US space agency Nasa suggests the fire that broke out on the\nslopes of Africa\u2019s highest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro, last week is still active, after dying down in recent days. Nasa's Fire Information for Resource Management System, which uses satellite data to detect thermal hot spots, shows the fire has spread again, after burning in just one place over the weekend. On Sunday, the Tanzanian\nauthorities said firefighters and volunteers had managed to\ncontain large parts of the fire. They were tackling the blaze in a ravine near\na popular camp site for hikers. The government is yet to issue another update. The fire comes two years after a week-long inferno destroyed\nthousands of hectares of woodland on Mount Kilimanjaro's slopes. By Jake Horton BBC Reality Check Law and order promises to be a key talking point in the US midterms. We look at the numbers. Peter Mwai BBC Reality Check Information collected by US space agency, Nasa, appears to corroborate the claim by the  Tanzanian authorities that much of the fire on the slopes of Africa\u2019s highest peak, Mount Kilimanjaro, has been contained. Nasa\u2019s Fire Information\nfor Resource Management System, which uses satellite data to detect\nthermal hot spots, showed a fire burning in just one place on Sunday. The system doesn\u2019t\nindicate any active fire in the location on Monday \u2013 although it\u2019s possible the\nlatest data has not yet been uploaded. The most recent aerial\nsatellite image of the fire \u2013 taken on Sunday - doesn\u2019t give us a clear enough\nview of what\u2019s happened because of cloud cover. However, a satellite\nimage from Saturday showed a thick cloud of smoke rising, with\nthe fire burning across a length of about 3 km (1.9 miles). The fire comes two years\nafter a week-long inferno destroyed thousands of hectares of woodland on Mount\nKilimanjaro's slopes. Mount Kilimanjaro, which\nis 5,895m (19,341ft) high, is a popular tourist destination and tens of\nthousands of people climb it every year.

DJ Edu Presenter of This Is Africa on BBC World Service Mozambique isn't a country I report on a lot, but DJ Tarico is putting it firmly on the musical map.  He's a super versatile producer who seems to be able to turn out hit after hit with different artists and in several musical genres. Now he's conquered the amapiano scene with tracks so good even the South Africans are fooled. Already making waves across the continent with his 2020 hit Yaba Buluku, he gained global exposure the following year when Burna Boy collaborated on a remix of the song. DJ Tarico began experimenting in music back in 2010 when a school friend taught him how to play with sounds on a computer. He also had a friend who was a DJ so he had two people to guide him at the start, and in the beginning he was producing hip hop because that was what he listened to most.  \"When I felt I was producing good, I tried to change a bit. One thing that I like is to keep growing. I don't like to be static.\" So he changed from hip hop to Kuduro. \"Kuduro is the style of Angola. Kuduro at that time was rocking all over the place. So then I moved from Kuduro to Kizomba, that dance when people are too close!,\" he laughs. \"After that I changed to Panza, our regional style here. That time I became a big producer here in Mozambique when I started producing local styles here.\" He says that Panza was invented by DJ Ardiles and Ziqo.  \"They tried to mix Raga music with Marabenta. We tried to put more electronics on the traditional sounds.\" He says it was quite hard back then as they didn't know anything about the music industry,   \"we were just doing it\". He later switched again to Amapiano. \"At that time amapiano was growing in Moz, so why not?\"  Burna Boy heard Yaba Buluku in a club and jumped on board the track propelling to the global stage with the remix. DJ Tarico says the track changed his life. \"Now DJ Tarico is not a local artist, he's an international artist. It's the first time in Mozambique you see? It's a hope for more Mozambican artists. It's like a spark. They are now working more because they know that it's possible. I became like an example here in Mozambique.\" As a result he says the music industry is now changing in Mozambique, with artists becoming more aware of digital platforms on which to promote their work. But DJ Tarico has no plans to leave Mozambique in order to enhance his career. \"From Southern Africa we don't like to emigrate too much. It's sweet bro!\" Stars of the sequel including Michaela Coel, Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira walk the red carpet.
